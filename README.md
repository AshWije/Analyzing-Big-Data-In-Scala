# Analyzing Big Data in Scala

This repository includes six different scala projects that perform various tasks aimed at analyzing
big data. Two are DataBricks scala notebooks, while the remaining four are standalone scala programs
designed to run with Apache Spark.

This is done in order to learn the best methods and tools for analyzing data and to better understand
the data itself.
